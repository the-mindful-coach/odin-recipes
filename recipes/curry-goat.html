        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                   <li>Wash the goat meat in water with the vinegar and juice from the lime/lemon. Drain away all excess water.</li>
                   <li>In a large enough bowl, season the meat with 1Â½ tablespoon of curry powder, salt, all-purpose seasoning, pimento, ginger, scotch bonnet pepper, scallion, onion, and garlic. Drizzle about 2-3 tablespoons of oil over the meat and rub the seasoning in and leave to marinate for a least 2 hours (overnight is best).</li>
                   <li>  Place a pot on medium heat and add about 2 tablespoon of cooking oil and the  remaining one tablespoon curry powder. Let the oil heat up (make sure not to burn the curry powder).</li>
                   <li> Add the goat meat and allow it to seared on all sides.</li>
                   <li>  Add enough water to the pot to cover the meat. Cover and leave to cook for an hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours or until meat tender. Occasionally, check to make sure enough water is always in the pot.</li>
