        <h2> Notes</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you use the water from the canned kidney beans, the finished rice will have the rice vibrate colour. I have never used water from the canned beans, so I can’t say if it is a good idea or not.</li>
                        <li>I use pink himalayan salt.</li>
                    </ul>
